# Final Java Web Project
Front end


# What is this project
This project was done for our final work in our Java Web class

## Description

This website is a sort of dictionnary where information was gathered (quickly not professionally) and put together. 

There is a list of countries and a page to answer questions. 

The questions page is composed of a component that displays it and in the component there is a verify button that tells you if you answered correctly or not. In the contries page there is two button on each country component, one of them brings you to a 'details' page with an interactive map and the others to the quiz page but with only questions that are for that country.

# Technologies 
This project is based on React a technology created by Meta. 

It uses react router (https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
As well as TimeAgo (https://github.com/nmn/react-timeago) and React Simple Maps (https://www.react-simple-maps.io/) 

Spring Boot was used for the backend which can be seen here (https://github.com/DylanBrass/CountriesWebsiteProject/blob/master/README.md)

These are all the important files :

We can see that for router I had to create the pages folder and all of these pages are linked with the index.js which the code ressembles this :
`jsx   
<BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
          <Route index element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="Quiz" element={<Quiz />} />
          <Route path="EditPage" element={<EditPage />} />
          <Route path="Countries" element={<Countries />} />
          <Route path="mapPage" element={<MapPage />} />
          <Route path="CreateQuestion" element={<CreateQuestionPage />} />
          <Route path="*" element={<NoPage />} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
    `
   
The components folder contains the map library previously mentioned, how I display my questions and my countries


The last one is more interesting because it is a fix that I needed because of the large amount o text I had. 
The componend ScrollToTop is used to remedy the proble of starting in the middle of the page.
